Live Laugh Love :)
I am looking right at the other half of me
I am just a man not a hero
Let us love like there are no goodbyes
Every little thing gonna be alright
You are Beautiful no matter what they say
It is a beautiful day Dont let it get away
love for all hatred for none
change the world by being yourself
Change the world by being yourself
Every moment is a fresh beginning
Never regret anything that made you smile
Everything you can imagine is real
Whatever you do do it well
Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication
Die with memories not dreams
What we think we become
